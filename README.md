# MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains a simple implementation of digit classification using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset. The code includes the following components:

1. Loading the MNIST dataset for digit classification.
2. Preprocessing the data, including normalization and flattening of images.
3. Building and training a basic neural network model.
4. Evaluating the model on the test dataset.
5. Visualizing predictions and creating a confusion matrix.
6. Building and training a more complex neural network model.
7. Building and training a convolutional neural network model.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Akshat-Raii/mnist-digit-classification.git
    cd mnist-digit-classification
 

2. Run the code:
    python mnist_classification.py

The code will load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, build, train, and evaluate the neural network models. Additionally, it will visualize predictions and create confusion matrices.
